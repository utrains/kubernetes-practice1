#
# first add a taint to nodeone.example.com:
# kubectl taint node nodeone.example.com color=pink:NoSchedule
# 
# add taint for nodetwo.example.com also:
# kubectl taint node nodetwo.example.com color=yellow:NoSchedule
#
# confirm that taint is applied on nodeone.example.com & nodetwo.example.com:
# kubectl describe node nodeone.example.com | grep Taint
# kubectl describe node nodetwo.example.com | grep Taint
#
# Create namespace geolocation -
# kubectl create namespace geolocation
#
# Create the pod which has tolerance for color pink
# Run the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-with-toleration1.yaml
#
# Check the pod
# kubectl get pods --namespace=geolocation
# (it should be running on nodeone.example.com)
# (because of taint and toleration)
#
# Remember: taint & tolerance is only for restricting
# nodes to ACCEPT only certain kind of pods. So,
# our pod can also go to other nodes, which are 
# NEUTRAL to taint (fragrance). But, nodeone.example.com
# will accept ONLY those pods which have pink taint (fragrance)
#
# Delete pod
# kubectl delete pod/webserver --namespace=geolocation
#
# Delete the taints from the nodes:
# kubectl taint node nodeone.example.com color:NoSchedule-
# kubectl taint node nodetwo.example.com color:NoSchedule-
#
# Describe the node master and understand why a pod is never assigned there
# kubectl describe node master.example.com | grep Taint
